#Notelified

Notelified is a Web App based off of the Web Development Bootcamp course by Angela Yu.
My goal was to add a lot of functionality to the app using what I've learned through the course and try to solve problems myself.
Several funtionalities that I felt like were missing and have then added were:
 -Create Custom List page, where users are able to make a new list.
 -Your Lists page, where users can see their current lists and delete those that they do not need.
 -Added a feature that allows users to edit specific items in their lists by tapping on the text.
